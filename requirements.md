# Software Requirements

## Vision:
We are going to build a social media platform specifically for pets and pet owners. Our application is designed to specifically cater to pet lovers so that they dont have to deal with all the extra clutter of traditional social media platforms. You should care about our prduct because it is awesome.

## Scope
Our product will allow users to post pet profiles along with picture videos and descriptions as well allow users to comment and like said posts. Our product will not slow the creeping spread of fascism and conspiracy culture that is tearing our society apart at the seams.

## MVP

Our products mvp will be a functioning social media platform with all of the basic functionality one expects from said platform.

## Stretch

Our stretch goals include adding a messaging feature, as well as direct payments to users in the form of 'tips'. Time permiting we will add other features that we havent thought up yet.

## Functional Requirements
 
 1) add users
 1) add pets
 1) add posts
 1) add/delete comments

## Non-functional Requirements

1) testable
1) o-auth
1) TDD

Testability is essential to the integrity of our prduct ensuring viable end result. We also are going to implement security features. To do this we are using o-auth which allows  us outsource our authentication via google. 

## Data Flow
First a user signs up via o-auth. Then they create a pet profile. Then they create posts for their pets. These posts can be commented on by other users.
